# PWA Icon Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder references for the PWA icons. In a production deployment, these would be replaced with actual PNG icon files:

## Required Icon Files:
- 16.png (16x16 pixels) - Browser favicon
- 32.png (32x32 pixels) - Browser favicon  
- 48.png (48x48 pixels) - Extension icon
- 128.png (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store
- 192.png (192x192 pixels) - Android home screen
- 512.png (512x512 pixels) - Splash screen

## Design Requirements:
- **Discrete Design**: Icons should appear as generic system utility tools
- **Non-Descriptive**: Avoid any tactical, military, or operational imagery
- **Generic Appearance**: Use common system icons like gears, monitors, or diagnostic symbols
- **Professional Look**: Clean, modern design suitable for business/utility applications

## Suggested Icon Concepts:
- System settings gear icon
- Computer monitor with diagnostic symbols
- Generic utility wrench/screwdriver
- System performance graph
- Generic maintenance tools

## Color Scheme:
- Primary: #424242 (Dark Gray)
- Secondary: #757575 (Medium Gray)  
- Accent: #2196F3 (Blue)
- Background: #FAFAFA (Light Gray)

These icons are critical for maintaining the discrete nature of the tactical PWA, ensuring it appears as a mundane system utility to casual observers.
